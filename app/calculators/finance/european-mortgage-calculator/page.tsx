 { question: 'How accurate are the calculations?', answer: 'This European Mortgage Calculator uses standard mathematical finance formulas; the result is an educational scenario rather than a professional quote. Results assume consistent inputs and standard market conditions. Actual investment returns, taxes, and financial outcomes will vary based on market performance, tax law changes, and individual circumstances. Use results for planning purposes, not as guarantees.' },
 { question: 'Should I consult a financial advisor?', answer: 'For major financial decisions, consider advice from a qualified professional in the relevant country. This European Mortgage Calculator provides a calculation based on the inputs and assumptions shown, but a licensed professional can account for your complete financial picture, tax situation, and long-term goals in ways a calculator cannot.' },
 { question: 'Does this account for inflation?', answer: 'Where applicable, this European Mortgage Calculator uses nominal values (current dollars) by default. For long-term projections, always consider that inflation varies by country and time; use a scenario assumption appropriate to the market you are analyzing. To get inflation-adjusted (real) returns, account for inflation only when an inflation assumption is explicitly provided from the nominal return rate. For example, a nominal 8% return with a 3% inflation assumption gives an approximate 5% real-return scenario before taxes and fees.' },
 { question: 'Are these calculations based on local tax rules?', answer: 'Tax treatment depends on the country, tax year, filing status, and individual circumstances. This calculator uses the assumptions shown in its inputs and is intended for planning and education. Verify current rules with the relevant tax authority or a qualified local professional before making a tax decision.' },
 { question: 'What are the limitations of financial calculators?', answer: 'Financial calculators, including this European Mortgage Calculator, assume consistent contribution rates, steady returns, and tax assumptions shown on this page - which never perfectly match reality. Markets fluctuate, tax laws change, and life circumstances evolve. Use projections as directional guides rather than precise predictions. The most valuable insight is understanding the relationship between variables (rate, time, amount) not the exact output number.' },
