              <p>Sep Ira is a USA investment or financial product that offers distinct advantages depending on your goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Understanding how it works is key to making the most of your money.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4 text-base">What is Solo 401K?</h3>
              <p>Solo 401K takes a different approach to growing or protecting your wealth. Each has its own risk profile, liquidity characteristics, and tax treatment that makes it suited to specific financial situations.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4 text-base">Key Differences</h3>
              <p>The most important distinction between Sep Ira and Solo 401K is how returns are generated and taxed. Sep Ira typically suits growth-oriented investors while Solo 401K may appeal to those prioritizing stability or specific tax advantages.</p>

              <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 text-base">Tax Treatment in USA</h3>
              <p>Tax efficiency dramatically affects real returns. Gains from each option may be subject to capital gains (0-20%) or ordinary income tax. Using the calculator above helps you see the true post-tax outcome based on your specific situation and contribution level.</p>
              <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-4 text-base">Which Is Better for Retirement Planning?</h3>
              <p>The right choice depends on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax bracket. For goals 5+ years away, higher-return options (10-12% historical) generally beat lower-return stable options (4-5%). For goals under 3 years, capital preservation takes priority.</p>

        category="finance"
        intro={`Self-employed individuals and small business owners have two powerful retirement account options that are largely unknown to employees but can shelter dramatically more income than a standard employee 401k. Both SEP-IRA and Solo 401k have 2024 contribution limits of up to $69,000 — nearly three times the standard employee 401k limit of $23,000.

The Solo 401k (or Individual 401k) allows both an employee contribution (up to $23,000 in 2024, or $30,500 if 50+) plus an employer contribution of up to 25% of compensation, subject to the combined $69,000 cap. This employee contribution feature means Solo 401k users can shelter more income at lower net business income levels compared to SEP-IRA.

SEP-IRA is simpler — no plan documents, no annual IRS filings for balances under $250,000, and easy to set up at any brokerage. Contributions are purely employer contributions at 25% of net self-employment income (up to $69,000). At high income levels (above $200,000 of net SE income), both plans reach the same maximum contribution. At lower income levels, the Solo 401k typically allows higher contributions because of the employee contribution component.`}
        howItWorks={`SEP-IRA contribution: 25% × (net SE income - half of SE tax). Net SE income = business revenue - business expenses. Half of SE tax is deductible. Maximum: $69,000 in 2024. For $100,000 net SE income: approximate max contribution = $18,587.

Solo 401k contribution: Employee contribution (up to $23,000) + employer contribution (25% of net SE income for sole proprietors, or 25% of W-2 wages for S-corps). At $100,000 net SE income: approximately $23,000 (employee) + $18,587 (employer) = $41,587 — $23,000 more than SEP-IRA at this income level.

Break-even income: The income level at which SEP-IRA and Solo 401k reach the same maximum contribution. Approximately $180,000+ in net SE income, where both approaches cap at $69,000.`}

        tipsSection={`Solo 401k wins at income levels below $200,000 because the employee contribution component allows higher total contributions. For very high earners reaching the $69,000 combined cap regardless of structure, SEP-IRA's simplicity makes it attractive.

For business owners with employees: Solo 401k is only available to businesses with no full-time employees other than the owner and spouse. If you have employees, you must use SEP-IRA or another qualified plan that covers them. SEP-IRA coverage requirements mean all eligible employees must receive contributions at the same percentage as the owner.

Both Solo 401k and SEP-IRA can be structured as Roth for the employee portion (Solo 401k only — no Roth SEP available). Roth Solo 401k contributions don't reduce current taxes but provide tax-free growth and withdrawals — valuable if your income is high now but you expect even higher retirement income.`}
        conclusion={`The tax savings from maxing a SEP-IRA or Solo 401k can be extraordinary for high-income self-employed individuals. A freelancer earning $250,000 who maxes the Solo 401k at $69,000 saves approximately $24,150 in federal income taxes at 35% marginal rate — an immediate 35% return before any investment growth.

For S-Corp owners, the S-Corp structure can optimize both salary and retirement contributions: set a reasonable salary (for FICA purposes) and take the remainder as distributions, then maximize Solo 401k contributions on the salary portion. This requires a CPA for proper implementation but can produce significant tax savings at high income levels.`}
