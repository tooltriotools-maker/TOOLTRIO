 { question: 'Is the Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA free to use?', answer: 'Yes, the Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA is completely free - no account registration, subscription, or payment of any kind required. All calculations are performed locally in your browser, meaning your financial data is never transmitted or stored anywhere. We believe professional-grade financial calculators should be accessible to every American regardless of income.' },
 { question: 'How accurate are the calculations?', answer: 'This Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA uses standard financial formulas recognized by certified financial planners (CFPs), CPAs, and investment advisors across the United States. Results assume consistent inputs and standard market conditions. Actual investment returns, taxes, and financial outcomes will vary based on market performance, tax law changes, and individual circumstances. Use results for planning purposes, not as guarantees.' },
 { question: 'Should I consult a financial advisor?', answer: 'For major financial decisions (retirement planning, large investments, tax strategy, estate planning), consulting a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or CPA is strongly recommended. This Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA provides solid educational estimates and planning scenarios, but a licensed professional can account for your complete financial picture, tax situation, and long-term goals in ways a calculator cannot.' },
 { question: 'Does this account for inflation?', answer: 'Where applicable, this Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA uses nominal values (current dollars) by default. For long-term projections, always consider that inflation historically averages 2-3% annually in the United States. To get inflation-adjusted (real) returns, subtract your expected inflation rate from your nominal return rate. For example, if your investment earns 8% and inflation is 3%, your real return is approximately 5%.' },
 { question: 'Are the calculations based on US tax law?', answer: 'This Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA uses US financial conventions and, where applicable, current US tax brackets and contribution limits. Tax law changes annually - verify current IRS limits (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.) at IRS.gov. For non-US users, contribution limits and tax treatment will differ significantly. Always verify current figures with your tax professional.' },
 { question: 'Is my financial data stored or shared?', answer: 'No. All calculations run entirely in your browser. No financial data - income, savings, investment amounts, or personal details - is ever transmitted to any server, stored in any database, or shared with any third party. When you close the tab, everything disappears. Your financial privacy is completely protected.' },
 { question: 'What are the limitations of financial calculators?', answer: 'Financial calculators, including this Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA, assume consistent contribution rates, steady returns, and static tax rates - which never perfectly match reality. Markets fluctuate, tax laws change, and life circumstances evolve. Use projections as directional guides rather than precise predictions. The most valuable insight is understanding the relationship between variables (rate, time, amount) not the exact output number.' },
 { question: 'Can I use this calculator for both US and international currencies?', answer: 'This Total Market vs S&P 500 Calculator USA supports multiple currencies - USD ($), GBP (£), EUR (€), and INR (₹) where applicable. For global users, note that contribution limits, tax treatment, and regulatory frameworks vary significantly by country. The mathematical calculations are currency-agnostic, but country-specific planning should involve a local financial professional.' },
