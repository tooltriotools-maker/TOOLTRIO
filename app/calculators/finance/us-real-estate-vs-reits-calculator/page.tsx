 { question: 'How accurate are the calculations?', answer: 'This US Real Estate vs REITs Calculator uses standard financial formulas recognized by certified financial planners (CFPs), CPAs, and investment advisors across the United States. Results assume consistent inputs and standard market conditions. Actual investment returns, taxes, and financial outcomes will vary based on market performance, tax law changes, and individual circumstances. Use results for planning purposes, not as guarantees.' },
 { question: 'Should I consult a financial advisor?', answer: 'For major financial decisions (retirement planning, large investments, tax strategy, estate planning), consulting a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) or CPA is strongly recommended. This US Real Estate vs REITs Calculator provides solid educational estimates and planning scenarios, but a licensed professional can account for your complete financial picture, tax situation, and long-term goals in ways a calculator cannot.' },
 { question: 'Does this account for inflation?', answer: 'Where applicable, this US Real Estate vs REITs Calculator uses nominal values (current dollars) by default. For long-term projections, always consider that inflation historically averages 2-3% annually in the United States. To get inflation-adjusted (real) returns, subtract your expected inflation rate from your nominal return rate. For example, if your investment earns 8% and inflation is 3%, your real return is approximately 5%.' },
 { question: 'Are the calculations based on US tax law?', answer: 'This US Real Estate vs REITs Calculator uses US financial conventions and, where applicable, current US tax brackets and contribution limits. Tax law changes annually - verify current IRS limits (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.) at IRS.gov. For non-US users, contribution limits and tax treatment will differ significantly. Always verify current figures with your tax professional.' },
 { question: 'What are the limitations of financial calculators?', answer: 'Financial calculators, including this US Real Estate vs REITs Calculator, assume consistent contribution rates, steady returns, and static tax rates - which never perfectly match reality. Markets fluctuate, tax laws change, and life circumstances evolve. Use projections as directional guides rather than precise predictions. The most valuable insight is understanding the relationship between variables (rate, time, amount) not the exact output number.' },
