 { question: 'How accurate are the calculations?', answer: 'This Dividend Growth vs Growth Stocks Calculator uses standard financial formulas recognized by certified financial planners (CFPs), CPAs, and investment advisors across the United States. Results assume consistent inputs and standard market conditions. Actual investment returns, taxes, and financial outcomes will vary based on market performance, tax law changes, and individual circumstances. Use results for planning purposes, not as guarantees.' },
 { question: 'Should I consult a financial advisor?', answer: 'For major financial decisions (retirement planning, large investments, tax strategy, estate planning), considering advice from a qualified financial professional (CFP) or CPA is strongly recommended. This Dividend Growth vs Growth Stocks Calculator provides a calculation based on the inputs and assumptions shown, but a licensed professional can account for your complete financial picture, tax situation, and long-term goals in ways a calculator cannot.' },
 { question: 'Does this account for inflation?', answer: 'Where applicable, this Dividend Growth vs Growth Stocks Calculator uses nominal values (current dollars) by default. For long-term projections, always consider that inflation historically averages 2-3% annually in the United States. To get inflation-adjusted (real) returns, account for inflation only when an inflation assumption is explicitly provided from the nominal return rate. For example, if your investment earns 8% and inflation is 3%, your real return is approximately 5%.' },
 { question: 'Are the calculations based on US tax law?', answer: 'This Dividend Growth vs Growth Stocks Calculator uses US financial conventions and, where applicable, current US tax brackets and contribution limits. Tax law changes annually - verify current IRS limits (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.) at IRS.gov. For non-US users, contribution limits and tax treatment will differ significantly. Always verify current figures with your tax professional.' },
 { question: 'What are the limitations of financial calculators?', answer: 'Financial calculators, including this Dividend Growth vs Growth Stocks Calculator, assume consistent contribution rates, steady returns, and tax assumptions shown on this page - which never perfectly match reality. Markets fluctuate, tax laws change, and life circumstances evolve. Use projections as directional guides rather than precise predictions. The most valuable insight is understanding the relationship between variables (rate, time, amount) not the exact output number.' },
